## Step 20: Publish Your Package to NPM
- Add a Shebang Line: Ensure the first line of your cli.js file starts with a shebang line that specifies the path to the Node.js interpreter. This line is crucial for letting the system know that the script should be run with Node.js.
- Make sure everything is perfect on the package.json. See the additional commands added for CLI to work. Test this locally with `npm link` and running the command.
- *Update the Version*: Update the version in package.json.
- *Create an npm Account*: If you don't have an npm account, create one at npmjs.com.
- *Update the Readme*: Update the Readme to include the commands that you would want to show up on npmjs.com.
- *Login to npm*: In your terminal, log in to npm using npm login and enter your credentials.
- *Publish the Package*:
    - Run `npm publish` in your project directory.
    - Ensure there are no errors in the output, and your package should now be live on npm.
- *Verify Publication*:
    - Check your package on the npm website - https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylusdb-sql. 
    - Try installing it in a separate project using `npm install stylusdb-sql`
